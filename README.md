Free Functions Plugin
This is an empty plugin. It is useful for inserting custom functions.

It will not be updated, so your custom functions will not be removed (it doesn’t have an update function).

Example of use – Inserting content using hooks: https://web-zone.org/documentation/what-are-hooks-and-how-to-use-them
